# `155` averageIntegers

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use the skeleton provided to write a working implementation.

2. You need to discover the average of a list or array of numbers.

3. Use the `sum` function to help you sum the numbers in the list.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Do not leave any functions in the skeleton unused.

+ Test that your implementation works.

+ Both functions should receive an `array` of numbers.
