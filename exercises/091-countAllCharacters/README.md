# `091` countAllCharacters

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `countAllCharacters`. Given a string, `countAllCharacters` returns an object where each key is a character in the given string. 

## Example:

```js
let output = countAllCharacters('banana');
console.log(output); // --> {b: 1, a: 3, n: 2}
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The value of each key should be how many times each character appeared in the given string.

+ If given an empty string, `countAllCharacters` should return an empty object.
