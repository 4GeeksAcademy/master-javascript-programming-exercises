# `144` multiplyBetween

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `multiplyBetween`.

Given 2 integers, `multiplyBetween` returns the product between the two given integers, beginning at `num1`, and excluding `num2`.

## :bulb: Hint:

* The product between `1` and `4` is `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

* If `num2` is not greater than `num1`, it should return `0`.

```Js
var output = multiplyBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 24
```
