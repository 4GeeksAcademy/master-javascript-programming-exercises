# `85` getIndexOf

## 📝 Instructions 

Write a function called "getIndexOf".

Given a character and a string, "getIndexOf" returns the first position of the given character in the given string.

Notes:
* Strings are zero indexed, meaning the first character in a string is at position 0.
* When a string contains more than one occurrence of a character, it should return the index of its first occurrence.
* If the character does not exist in the string, it should return -1.
* Do not use the native indexOf function in your implementation.

```js
var output = getIndexOf('a', 'I am a hacker');
console.log(output); // --> 2
```
