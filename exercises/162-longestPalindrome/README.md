# `162` longestPalindrome

## 📝 Instrucciones:

1. Implement a function that finds the longest palindrome in a given string.

For example, in the string `My dad is a racecar athlete`, the longest palindrome is `a racecar a`. **Count whitespaces as valid characters**. 

Other palindromes in the above string include "dad", "ete", " dad " (including the whitespace on each side of dad).

## :bulb: Pista:

* Use every function.

* If there are multiple palindromes with the same lenght, return the last one. 

* It should not be case sensitive.
