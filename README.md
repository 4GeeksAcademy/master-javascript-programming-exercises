## One click installation:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-javascript-programming-exercises.git)

## Local Installation (only if needed)

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:

```sh
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-node
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recommendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recommendation or you can get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.js**: Represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md**: Contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js**: Contains the testing script for the exercise (you don't have to open this file).
