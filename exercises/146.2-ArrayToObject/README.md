# `146.2` ArraytoObject

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `fromListToObject` which takes in an array of arrays, and returns an object with *each pair of elements in the array as a key-value pair*.

## Example input:

```Js
[['make', 'Ford'], ['model', 'Mustang'], ['year', 1964]]
```

## Example output:

```Js
{
  make : 'Ford'
  model : 'Mustang',
  year : 1964
}
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ Do not change the input string. Assume that all elements in the array will be of type `string`.

+ Note that the input may have a different number of elements than the given sample.  For instance, if the input had 6 values instead of 4, your code should flexibly accommodate that.
