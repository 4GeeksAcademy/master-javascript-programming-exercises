### 160 exercises about JavaScript

Complete selection of auto-graded and interactive JavaScript exercises, where you will put your problem-solving skills to the test and learn many of the most popular JavaScript methods. 

> One key thing to learn in the world of coding is that the same problem may have multiple valid solutions, the important thing is that you understand the logic and principles behind them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/master-javascript-programming-exercises) (recommended), [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-javascript-programming-exercises) or or [Open in Codeanywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-javascript-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, if exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation (only if needed)

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the node compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ learnpack start
```
<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **app.js**: Represents the entry JavaScript file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md**: Contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js**: Contains the testing script for the exercise (you don't have to open this file).

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
