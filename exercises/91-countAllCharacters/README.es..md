# `91` countAllCharacters

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `ountAllCharacters`.

Given a string,`countAllCharacters` returns an object where each key is a character in the given string. The value of each key should be how many times each character appeared in the given string.

```js
var output = countAllCharacters('banana');
console.log(output); // --> {b: 1, a: 3, n: 2}
```
## :bulb: Hint:
