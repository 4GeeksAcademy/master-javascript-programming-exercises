# `88` Select

## 📝 Instructions

Write a function called "select".

Given an array and an object, "select" returns a new object whose properties are those in the given object AND whose keys are present in the given array. 

Notes:
* If keys are present in the given array, but are not in the given object, it should ignore them. 
* It does not modify the passed in object.

```js
var arr = ['a', 'c', 'e'];
var obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
  d: 4
};
var output = select(arr, obj);
console.log(output); // --> { a: 1, c: 3 }
```
